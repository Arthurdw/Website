# Visiting Oracle in Dublin

Our trip with HOWEST to Dublin started with a visit to [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/), one of the leading technology companies in the world. Despite the rainy welcome by the Dublin weather, our spirits remained undamped.

At Oracle, we were given an overview of the company, its mission, and its operations. It was fascinating to learn about the scale at which Oracle operates and the diverse range of services it offers.

The highlight of the visit was a workshop where we were tasked with finding a solution for a jet motor producer to be more resilient against uncontrollable disasters like the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic). This exercise not only tested our problem-solving skills but also gave us a glimpse into the real-world challenges that businesses face and how technology can be leveraged to overcome them.

Despite the weather, our visit to Oracle was an enriching experience that gave us valuable insights into the tech industry. We look forward to more such visits in the future.

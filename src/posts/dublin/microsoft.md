After an insightful morning at [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com) *(see [the Oracle blog post](./oracle.md))*, our HOWEST group made our way to our second visit of the day - [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) in Dublin. 

At Microsoft, we were greeted with a series of talks that covered a range of topics. We delved into the world of Artificial Intelligence, explored the intricacies of Security, and got a glimpse into the vast expanse of their Azure cloud. Each talk was a treasure trove of information, shedding light on the cutting-edge technologies that Microsoft is working on.

But the visit was not just about the talks. Microsoft's Dublin office is an architectural marvel, and we had the opportunity to explore it. The highlight of our tour was undoubtedly the roof,  which offered an amazing view

The visit to Microsoft was an enriching experience, providing us with a deeper understanding of the tech giant's operations and culture. It was a day filled with learning, exploration, and awe-inspiring views. As we left the building, we carried with us not just the knowledge we had gained, but also the memories of a truly remarkable visit.

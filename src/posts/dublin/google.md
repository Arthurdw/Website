On the final day of the HOWEST Dublin week, we had the privilege of visiting [Google](https://www.google.com)'s Dublin site. 

Upon arrival, we were warmly welcomed and while waiting for our guides, I had the opportunity to relax in a massage chair, a small but delightful perk of the Google office. 

Our visit was filled with insights into Google's capabilities with Artificial Intelligence. The explanations provided were comprehensive and gave us a glimpse into the advanced technologies that Google is developing.

In addition to the technical insights, I had the chance to converse with some of Google's employees. They shared their experiences of working at Google, painting a picture of a dynamic, innovative, and rewarding work environment. 

As our visit to Google came to a close, so did our Dublin week. We left the Google site with a deeper understanding of the tech giant and a sense of excitement about the possibilities in the tech world. The flight back to Belgium was filled with reflections on our enriching experiences in Dublin.

The HOWEST Dublin week was a journey of learning, exploration, and fun. As we look forward to our next adventure, we carry with us the memories and knowledge from our visits to [Oracle](./oracle.md), [Microsoft](./microsoft.md), [Meta](./meta.md), and Google.

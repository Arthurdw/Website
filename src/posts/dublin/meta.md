On Thursday, we had the opportunity to visit [Meta](https://www.meta.com)'s new office in Dublin. Despite the visit being relatively short, it was packed with excitement and fun.

The highlight of our visit was a quiz that Meta had organized for us. The quiz was a test of our knowledge and quick thinking, and I am proud to say that I emerged victorious. Winning the quiz was not just about the glory, but also about the prizes - a Meta notepad and a UK USB power dock. These are not just souvenirs, but reminders of the knowledge I gained and the fun I had at Meta.

The visit to Meta, though short, was a memorable one. It was a day of competition, and victory. As we left the new office, I carried not just the prizes, but also the memories of a truly enjoyable visit.

As a graduating student at HOWEST, I won a ticket at the [Flutter Belgium Meetup](./flutter-meetup-belgium.md) to join the [FlutterCon Europe 2024](https://fluttercon.dev/) in Berlin. The event was held at the CityCube Berlin. The conference was a three-day event, and it was packed with interesting talks, workshops, and networking opportunities.

## Opening Keynote

We received an amazing opening keynote by Andrew Brogdon, a key member of the Dart/Flutter team at Google. Coming all the way from California,he shared an overview of the current state, its roadmap and the influence and implementation of generative AI on its future. Including some of the big adoptions of Flutter in the industry.

On top of that, was there a random giveaway of the 120 [Flutter Engineering by Majid Hajian](https://amzn.to/4bEUmLo) books. Which I was fortunate enough to win one of!

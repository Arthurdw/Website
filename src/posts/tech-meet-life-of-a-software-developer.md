Last week, I had the privilege of attending a tech meet where [Michael Seghers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikeseghers/), the founder of Sweet Mustard and Team Lead of VRT Max, was the keynote speaker.

Michael's talk was centered around the full flow in software development. He shared his experiences and insights, shedding light on the intricacies of the software development process. From the initial stages of gathering requirements and designing the system, to the development, testing, and deployment stages, Michael covered it all.

One of the key takeaways from his talk was the importance of communication and collaboration in a software development team. He emphasized that a successful software project is not just about writing code, but also about understanding the needs of the client and working together as a team to deliver a solution that meets those needs.

Michael also stressed the importance of continuous learning and adapting to new technologies and methodologies in the ever-evolving field of software development.

Overall, it was an enlightening experience to hear from someone with such extensive experience in the field. I left the tech meet feeling inspired and motivated to apply the knowledge and insights I gained to my own work in software development.

# OpenAI API and Deno Event: A Gateway to Advanced Web Development

I recently attended a event where we learned how to consume the OpenAI API with Deno. This was a great event where we learned how to use the OpenAI API with Deno. We even got demo'ed a full schema generation from a sketch and a sql schema from a image.

## Deno

Deno is a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that is based on the V8 JavaScript engine and the Rust programming language. It was created by Ryan Dahl, the original creator of Node.js. Deno was created to fix the design mistakes in Node.js. Deno is secure by default, supports TypeScript out of the box, and has a built-in package manager, build in testing and linting tools, and a built-in runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. Which are improvements over Node.js.

## OpenAI API

The OpenAI API is a powerful tool that allows developers to access the models created by OpenAI. These models can be used for a variety of tasks, such as generating text, images, and code. The OpenAI API is easy to use and provides developers with access to some of the most advanced AI models available.

We got a demo of how to use the OpenAI API with Deno. We were shown how to use the API to generate a schema from a sketch and a sql schema from an image. This was a great demonstration of the power of the OpenAI API and how it can be used to automate tasks that would otherwise be time-consuming and difficult.

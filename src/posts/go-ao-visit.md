# I went back to visit my high school

I'm in my last year for my [Batchelor Applied Computer Science][cs-course] on [HOWEST][howest].
As part of the `Professional Networking` course we have to perform a PR
activity; together with [Jari][jari], [Jean Baptiste][jb], and [Ward][ward] we
went back to our high school to inform the students of IT Management about the
possibilities of the Applied Computer Science course and the specialisation
tracks.

## Meeting Up

In the morning we went back to Oudenaarde, which is where the
[GO-Atheneum Oudenaarde][go-ao] is situated. We all met up in front of the
school, eagerly waiting for our HOWEST professor to show up. We were quite
frankly not really sure of what we were going to do that day. No preparations,
or expectations were set for us. When the professor arrived, we felt some
comfort which was quickly broken, and then restored. He told us that we were
going to provide insights and reply to questions students would have.

This was going to be quite the challenge, as at the time we were only second
year students.

## The Talk

We met up with our old teachers, mainly the ones who gave the informatics
courses. After some chit-chatting the students started to walk in; and the
professor started his presentation.

He started talking about HOWEST as in intuition in general and went on a
deep-dive into all specialisations that the course provides.

## What can we improve/learn?

- Before doing something, inform yourself. This will reduce the stress for
  things and make it clear to what must happen. By making this clear you can
  prepare yourself!

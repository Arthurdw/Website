I recently had the opportunity to attend the [Flutter Belgium](https://flutterbelgium.be/) Meetup 2024 at HOWEST. It was an enlightening experience to see what Flutter is truly capable of and how developers are using it to solve complex problems.

One of the highlights of the event was a giveaway. I was fortunate enough to win tickets to [FlutterCon](https://fluttercon.dev/), which will be held this summer in Berlin. I'm excited to see what the conference has in store and will definitely keep you posted on my experiences there.

Stay tuned for more updates!

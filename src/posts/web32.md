# The future of decentralisation and web3

Every year there is a conference called [Web32] in Belgium. This year _(2023)_  
it was in Antwerpen on september 27'th. The conference attempts to provide
peek insights and inspiration about the future of Web3 projects.

As a students of HOWEST, we we able to get discounted tickets which were
otherwise pretty expensive.

## What did I learn?

The whole day was about brand exclusivity. This is because people now do not
only want something that works; they want to be unique; to be admired by peers
for owning something.

This is where the web3 comes in, as web3 is all about moving the ownership from
the platforms to the users.

This concept was mainly brought over by [SiteManager]. [Diego Borgo] and
[Samuel Eggermont]. These talks were really inspiring and gave some great ideas
for potential businesses. But it all came down to this, make something which is
easy to understand, easy to show off, can be used in different environments
(as it is on the chain) and most importantly; links back to your brand!

If you would be able to create such a loyalty program, then you're golden!

On another note, there was a talk from [Dave van Moppes] which was about taxes
regarding the crypto space. This was important because it gave some insights on
how taxes work _(in Belgium)_, and how that we should handle them. This is
important as I'm planning [Xiler] and need this to be fully compliant with the
law!

## TL;DR

- people don't own enough _(data is in control of the company)_
- people want to feel exclusive
- taxes are really important and complicated

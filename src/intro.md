## Welcome! üëã

Hello there, I'm Arthur. I'm a 20-year-old Freelance Software Engineering student at HOWEST University of Applied Sciences. I have a passion for building solutions for problems I encounter online. Currently, I'm deeply interested in low-level programming with Rust and DevOps with Docker, Terraform, and Ansible.

## Current Stack üõ†Ô∏è

Here's a list of technologies I'm currently using, ordered from most important:

1. Rust (with libraries like tokio, axum, poem-openapi)
2. TypeScript (primarily with Svelte & SvelteKit)
3. SCSS
4. Neovim & Neovide, Jetbrains IDE's with VIM bindings
5. Unix (You can see my configuration in my .dotfiles repository)
6. Docker
7. Git
8. Figma

## Technologies I'm Familiar With üí°

I have experience with a wide range of technologies including:

Python, Java, Go, Javascript (including libraries and frameworks like prisma, vue, react & NextJs, expressjs), SQL (with sqlite, cql for scylladb, mssql, mysql, postgresql), C# (&.NET), PHP (& Laravel), Windows, Docker, Markdown, CSS (& derivatives), Kotlin (& compose), Terraform, Ansible.

## Projects I'm Proud Of üèÜ

Here are some projects that I've worked on and am particularly proud of:

- [Pincer](https://github.com/Pincer-org/Pincer): In August 2021, I started a new Python library for Discord with my friend [Sigmanificient](https://github.com/Sigmanificient). My main role in this project was to write the core logic and library interactions (commands, etc).

- [Firefly](https://github.com/Arthurdw/firefly): As I was learning Rust, I wanted to create a useful application. Firefly, a 7mb DB, was born out of this desire. It has a custom protocol over TCP which supports both a human-friendly and a highly optimized binary command interface.

- [Xiler Decentralised DNS server](https://github.com/XilerNet/dns): A decentralized DNS server built on Bitcoin ordinals, adhering to the Xiler specification (which I also wrote). It supports name resolution, partial recursion, ipv4 & ipv6, various record types, and several cryptographic signatures.

- [IrefIndex](https://github.com/vibbits/irefindex): In partnership with the Flemish Institute for Biotechnology, VIB, we automated the deployment of a proton-proton database. This was a group project, and I primarily worked on the Terraform and Ansible scripts.

You can find other open source projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Arthurdw).

## Whitepapers üìÑ

I've written a comprehensive whitepaper on web solutions, where I delve into an in-depth analysis of React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Lit, and Hilla. If you're interested in understanding these technologies from a comparative perspective, feel free to read it here: [bachelor-dissertation/main.pdf](https://github.com/Arthurdw/bachelor-dissertation/blob/main/main.pdf).

# I went back to visit my high school

I'm in my last year for my [Batchelor Applied Computer Science][cs-course] on [HOWEST][howest].
As part of the `Professional Networking` course we have to perform a PR
activity; together with [Jari][jari], [Jean Baptiste][jb], and [Ward][ward] we
went back to our high school to inform the students of IT Management about the
possibilities of the Applied Computer Science course and the specialisation
tracks.

## Meeting Up

In the morning we went back to Oudenaarde, which is where the
[GO-Atheneum Oudenaarde][go-ao] is situated. We all met up in front of the
school, eagerly waiting for our HOWEST professor to show up. We were quite
frankly not really sure of what we were going to do that day. No preparations,
or expectations were set for us. When the professor arrived, we felt some
comfort which was quickly broken, and then restored. He told us that we were
going to provide insights and reply to questions students would have.

This was going to be quite the challenge, as at the time we were only second
year students.

## The Talk

We met up with our old teachers, mainly the ones who gave the informatics
courses. After some chit-chatting the students started to walk in; and the
professor started his presentation.

He started talking about HOWEST as in intuition in general and went on a
deep-dive into all specialisations that the course provides. And then, it
happened!

## The Danger

It was special, like nothing we had EVER experienced before!

Questions started popping up, and we were the ones that should answer them! And
surprisingly enough, we did! With some warm welcomed support from the professor
we tried to answer the questions honestly, while also attempting to motivate
the group to pursue this amazing Batchelor.

## The Aftermath

Once all questions were done, and we talked to some students; everything felt
okay and relaxed. We chatted a bit afterwards with our old teachers and with
the professor.

It was done, the task was a success!

## What can we improve/learn?

- Before doing something, inform yourself. This will reduce the stress for
  things and make it clear to what must happen. By making this clear you can
  prepare yourself!

- Just breathe; don't worry about what other people might think, at the end of
  the day they have mostly forgotten about what happened wrongly. Or they might
  not even notice it!
